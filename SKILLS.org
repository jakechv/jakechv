#+TITLE: Skills

This page contains a list of my skills.
The data should be primarily auto-generated,
but should accept manual overrides for the information.

As all of my projects should be public on GitHub,
I should be able to glean all of this information from my profile
by looking at the languages used.

I can also look at the information in my wiki and the frequency
at which different words are used.
Analyzing the wiki seems useful for a variety of reasons,
not just for putting skills on my resume!

This information should be rendered to [[https://jacob.chvatal.com/skills][my website]], [[my resume]] and [[https://linkedin.com/in/jacob-chvatal][my LinkedIn]].

Things to consider:
- Should descriptions be provided for each of the skills?
  These would not be rendered on my resume or linkedin.
- Should links be provided for each of the skills?
  These would not be on my linkedin and likely would not be on my resume.
